## Welcome

This is Makoto Sawada (澤田 真理)’s web page. 

I am an astrophysicist (宇宙物理学者), currently appointed as a Research Scientist (研究員) for the RIKEN Pioneering Project “Evolution of Matter in the Universe” ([r-EMU](http://stars.riken.jp/remu/index.html)) at [High Energy Astrophysics Laboratory](https://astro.riken.jp/?lang=en), Cluster for Pioneering Research (CRP: 開拓研究本部), RIKEN (理化学研究所), Japan, since 2020. Previously I was appointed as an Assistant Research Scientist at University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC), MD, USA, for about two years, through the Center for Research and Exploration in Space Science and Technology II ([CRESST II](https://cresst2.umd.edu/)), a collaboration with NASA Godddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), MD, USA. While I was at GSFC/UMBC, I was also appointed as a Visiting Scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), CA, USA. Prior to these appointments, I worked at Aoyama Gakuin University (青山学院大学) as an Assistant Professor (助教) for five years and half after I got my PhD from Kyoto University in 2012.

My research interests are non-equilibrium phenomena in hot (10<sup>7</sup> K) medium in the Universe, mainly supernova remnants, and the instrumentation for X-ray spectroscopy of such plasma. A (significant) part of my research activity is currently devoted to the development of the X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM), an international project between Japan and US with a participation of Europa. XRISM is expected to revolutionalize our understanding on supernova remnants and other high-energy astrophysical objects, and the spacecraft is scheduled to be launched soon.
