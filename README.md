**Hello, this is Makoto Sawada (澤田 真理)’s web page.**

## Welcome

- I am an astrophysicist, currently appointed at [Department of Physics](https://www.rikkyo.ac.jp/undergraduate/science/department_02.html), [Faculty of Science](https://www.rikkyo.ac.jp/undergraduate/science/), [Rikkyo University](https://www.rikkyo.ac.jp/), Japan, as an Assistant Professor.
- I was formerly appointed at [High Energy Astrophysics Laboratory](https://astro.riken.jp/?lang=en), Cluster for Pioneering Research (CRP), RIKEN, Japan, as a Research Scientist for the RIKEN Pioneering Project “Evolution of Matter in the Universe” ([r-EMU](http://stars.riken.jp/remu/index.html)) since 2020. 
- Until 2019, I was appointed as an Assistant Research Scientist at University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC), MD, USA, through the Center for Research and Exploration in Space Science and Technology II ([CRESST II](https://cresst2.umd.edu/)) program, a collaboration with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), MD, USA. While I was at GSFC/UMBC, I was also a Visiting Scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), CA, USA. 
- Prior to these appointments, I worked at Aoyama Gakuin University as an Assistant Professor for five years and half after I got my PhD from Kyoto University in 2012.

## Research interests

- My research interests are non-equilibrium phenomena in various hot (>10<sup>7</sup> K) medium in the Universe such as supernova remnants, and in association, the instrumentation for X-ray spectroscopy of such hot plasma. 
- A significant part of my research activity is currently devoted into the development and in-orbit operation/calibration planning of the Resolve high-resolution spectrometer on the X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission ([XRISM](https://xrism.isas.jaxa.jp/en/): X線撮像分光衛星). XRISM is an international project between Japan and US with a participation of Europa, [which was launched on September 7, 2023](https://www.mhi.com/news/230907.html). XRISM is expected to revolutionalize our understanding on high-energy astrophysical objects such as supernova remnants, clusters of galaxies, and blackholes. 
- The observational data to be obtained with XRISM/Resolve will be so precise and detailed that we are required to refine spectral models to get accurate interpretation of the observational data. For this purpose, I participate in the LLNL-GSFC laboratory astrophysics collaboration to experimentally simulate astrophysical hot and non-equilibrium plasma and their emission in a controlled laboratory setting using Electron Beam Ion Traps ([EBIT](https://ebit.llnl.gov/)). 
- I also occasionally contribute to updating X-ray spectral models such as [SPEX](https://www.sron.nl/astrophysics-spex) developed at SRON, the Netherlands.
