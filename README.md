# Makoto Sawada

## Welcome

This is Makoto Sawada (澤田 真理)’s web page. 

I am an astrophysicist (宇宙物理学者), currently appointed at [High Energy Astrophysics Laboratory](https://astro.riken.jp/?lang=en), Cluster for Pioneering Research (CRP: 開拓研究本部), RIKEN (理化学研究所), Japan, as a Research Scientist (研究員) for the RIKEN Pioneering Project “Evolution of Matter in the Universe” ([r-EMU](http://stars.riken.jp/remu/index.html)) since 2020. Previously I was appointed as an Assistant Research Scientist at University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC), MD, USA, for about two years, through the Center for Research and Exploration in Space Science and Technology II ([CRESST II](https://cresst2.umd.edu/)) program, a collaboration with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), MD, USA. While I was at GSFC/UMBC, I was also appointed as a Visiting Scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), CA, USA. Prior to these appointments, I worked at Aoyama Gakuin University (青山学院大学) as an Assistant Professor (助教) for five years and half after I got my PhD from Kyoto University in 2012.

## Research interests

My research interests are non-equilibrium phenomena in various hot (>10<sup>7</sup> K) medium in the Universe such as supernova remnants, and in association, the instrumentation for X-ray spectroscopy of such hot plasma. A significant part of my research activity is currently devoted into the development of the Resolve high-resolution spectrometer on the X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission ([XRISM](https://xrism.isas.jaxa.jp/en/): X線撮像分光衛星). XRISM is an international project between Japan and US with a participation of Europa, which is scheduled to be launched soon. XRISM is expected to revolutionalize our understanding high-energy astrophysical objects such as supernova remnants. The observational data to be obtained with XRISM/Resolve will be so precise and detailed that we need to refine spectral models required to interpret the data. For this purpose, I participate in the LLNL-GSFC laboratory astrophysics collaboration to simulate astrophysical hot and non-equilibrium plasma in a controlled laboratory setting using Electron Beam Ion Traps ([EBIT](https://ebit.llnl.gov/)). I also occasionally contribute to updating X-ray spectral models such as [SPEX](https://www.sron.nl/astrophysics-spex) developed at SRON, the Netherlands.
