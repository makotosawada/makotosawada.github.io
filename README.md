Previously I was appointed as an Assistant Research Scientist at University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC), USA, for about two years, through the Center for Research and Exploration in Space Science and Technology II (CRESST II), a collaboration with NASA Godddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), USA. Prior to this, I worked at Aoyama Gakuin University (青山学院大学) as an Assistant Professor (助教) for five years and half.
