## Welcome

This is Makoto Sawada's web page. 

I am an astrophysicist, currently appointed as a Research Scientist for the RIKEN Pioneering Project "Evolution of Matter in the Universe" (r-EMU) at Cluster for Pioneering Research (CRP), RIKEN (理化学研究所 開拓研究本部), Japan, since 2020. Previously I was appointed as an Assistant Research Scientist at University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC), USA, for about two years, through the Center for Research and Exploration in Space Science and Technology II (CRESST II), a collaboration with NASA Godddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), USA. Prior to this, I worked at Aoyama Gakuin University as an Assistant Professor for five years and half.
