## Welcome

This is Makoto Sawada (澤田 真理)’s web page. 

I am an astrophysicist, currently appointed as a Research Scientist (研究員) for the RIKEN Pioneering Project “Evolution of Matter in the Universe” (r-EMU) at Cluster for Pioneering Research (CRP: 開拓研究本部), RIKEN (理化学研究所), Japan, since 2020. Previously I was appointed as an Assistant Research Scientist at University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC), MD, USA, for about two years, through the Center for Research and Exploration in Space Science and Technology II (CRESST II), a collaboration with NASA Godddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), MD, USA. While I was at GSFC/UMBC, I was also appointed as a Visiting Scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), CA, USA. Prior to these appointments, I worked at Aoyama Gakuin University (青山学院大学) as an Assistant Professor (助教) for five years and half after I got my PhD at Kyoto University in 2012.
